This is source code from Pluralsight training:
Building Your First API with ASP.NET Core 2 by Kevin Dockx
In this course you'll learn how to build an API with ASP.NET Core that connects to a database via Entity Framework Core from scratch.

I used it to study (again) advanced Web.API. I slightly modified code from original one for studying purposes. 

Thank you,
Sam Klokov
